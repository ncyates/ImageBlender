# ImageBlender
Work in Progress.
This is a python project that uses OpenCV to blend multiple images together to create an abstract image. 
Mostly it started as an excercise in python programming and using OpenCV. I wrote it to blend together the grabbed frames of a video
to represent a merge of all frames. The results from the blending are lackluster and gray until further processing is performed.
To make the images more exciting, perform an auto-white balance using GIMP (or photoshop etc.)
... More to come.
